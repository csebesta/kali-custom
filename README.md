Kaliburn Linux
==============

**Kaliburn Linux** is a purely live distribution intended to meet the needs of IT professionals. It is derived from the standard Kali distribution, with a variety of modifications that make it a more useful tool for IT professionals.

Installation
------------

The Kaliburn image can be created by running the kaliburn.sh script.

```
cd kali-custom
./kaliburn.sh
```

Once the script has finished, simply write the image to a device of your choice. The device `/dev/sdf/` is used for this example, though yours may differ. Always be careful when using the `dd` command.

```
cd live-build-config/images
dd if=k
